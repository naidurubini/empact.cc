        <h3>grassroots action</h3>
        <p>We make activism more accessible by allowing you to select from trusted actions online or locally. We also think communities are most informed about their needs—and enable individuals to share their own calls to action. </p>

        <p>I met Ishitha when I was doing photographic fieldwork for the Bill & Melinda Gates Institue in New Delhi slums. She was bright-eyed and so curious about the world. Holding her in my arms, I realized that while she is likely just as attentive or promising as me or the next individual, her circumstances will likely prevent her from experiencing her full potential.</p>
